# Birthday App
Week 3 challenge; Creating a website that greets you on your birthday, using this example https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/intro_to_the_web/post_challenges/birthday_app.md

## My progression so far:

- app.rb has an index page ( / )
- you can submit your name and your birthday (days option accepts numbers from 1 to 31, months option is a list of months from January to December)
- after submissiom it jumps to the next page ( /birthday ) that says Happy Birthday! (celebration.erb)

## The following things are need to be done:
- Ruby logic is missing
- countdown page is not working yet (countdown.erb)
- Birthday page is not customized (can't use the details that have been submitted)
