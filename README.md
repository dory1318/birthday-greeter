# Birthday App
Week 3 challenge; using Ruby and HTLM + TDD process to create a website using this example https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/intro_to_the_web/post_challenges/birthday_app.md

## Goal
The website takes the visitor's name and birtday (day + month), then redirects the visitor to a page which either greets them on their birtday, or tells them the days until their birthday.

## My progress so far:

- you can submit your name and your birthday ('days' option accepts numbers from 1 to 31, 'months option' is a list of months from January to December)
- after submission it checks wheter the date is the same as today date or not
- if today is your birthday it redirects you to /birthday to greet you, if not, it redirects you to /countdown
- tests are passing

## The following things are need to be done:
- it can not tell yet how many day until your birthday
- need to write more tests
