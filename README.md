# Birthday App
Week 3 challenge; using Ruby and HTLM + TDD process to create a website using this example https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/intro_to_the_web/post_challenges/birthday_app.md

## Goal
The website takes the visitor's name and birtday (day + month), then redirects the visitor to a page which either greets them on their birtday, or tells them the days until their birthday.

## My progress so far:

- you can submit your name and your birthday (days option accepts numbers from 1 to 31, months option is a list of months from January to December)
- after submission it is redirected to /birthday where you are being greet personally (Happy Birthday #{@name}!!)
- tests are passing

## The following things are need to be done:
- if statement needs to be added so that can decide if /birthday or /countdown
